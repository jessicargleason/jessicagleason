					<p>I previously worked as an Interface Developer at <a href="https://www.ascedia.com" target="_blank">Ascedia</a>, an award-winning digital consultancy in Milwaukee, WI. Some of my favorite projects in my time there included: </p>
					<ul>
						<li><h3><a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/fall-color-report" target="_blank">Travel Wisconsin Fall Color Report</a> (and <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/snowreport/snowmobile" target="_blank">Snow Conditions Report</a>)</h3> 
							<p>I built the side navigation and informational panel from wireframes and visual representations. I also worked with a back-end developer to create templates using the lightweight <a href="https://idangero.us/template7" target="_blank">Template7</a> templating engine.</p></li>
						<li><h3><a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/trade-resources/reveal/" target="_blank">Sub-Zero and Wolf "Reveal" product configurator</a></h3>
							<p>I participated in the design process for this, providing feedback and creating prototypes as the workflows were created. I built the interface based on the resulting designs in collaboration with a team of back-end developers.</p></li>
						<li>
							<h3>Redesign of the <a href="https://www.countyofdane.com/" target="_blank">Dane County</a> portal</h3> 
							<p>I worked with developers from Dane County inside their development environment to build this new front-end on top of their existing, custom-made content management system. I also helped conceptualize a system of color schemes for use on the county's individual department sites and created an internal static site to serve as their pattern library.</p></li>
						<li><h3><a href="https://readynest.com/" target="_blank">MGIC Readynest</a></h3>
							<p> I built the interface for this site, which is built on Sitecore and uses Sitecore's Experience Editor, based on design documentation provided by MGIC and went onsite to collaborate with and train MGIC developers. I used an internally-developed CSS framework.</p></li>
					</ul>
						<p>I'm also on an advisory committee for <a href="https://www.matc.edu" target="_blank">Milwaukee Area Technical College</a>.</p> 
						<p>I've been building websites for over fifteen years. As a middle schooler, I was creating webpages and starting up forums. As a high schooler, I was skinning blogs and turning in websites as art projects in school. As a college student, I got practice meeting deadlines and facing critiques in the Web Designer and Visual Communication programs at Milwaukee Area Technical College. Now, as a professional developer I build accessible, quality experiences to help organizations meet their goals.</p>

					<h2>I also make websites for fun.</h2>
					<div class="flex">
						<div>
							<p>Recently, I made a website for the <a href="https://www.bimke.org" target="_blank">Bi+ Milwaukee organization</a>. I once made a <a href="https://www.sufjanshowdown.com/" target="_blank">website that ranks songs</a>. I also made this website right here.</p> 
							<h2>I do other things for fun, too.</h2>
							<p>I like baking cookies. I knit from time to time. I write a novel every November for <a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a>. I have pet hermit crabs. I love musical theater. You can find me <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JessicaRGleason" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>.</p>
